    <h1>WTF are SK8 RATZ?</h1>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SK8 RATZ are degenerate rodentz that shred the streetz of Cheezcago. Unfortunately, they get kicked out of their local sk8 spotz by sheriff Bae Kon quite too often. Word on the street is the Chief Rat developed a portal into the world of the permissionless and the RATZ are ready to drop in. But before they do, they need to line up a couch to crash on. 
      </p>
    <h2>So what are they really?</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SK8 RATZ are digital art collectibles that embody the counter-culture spirit of both skateboarding and crypto alike. At their core, SK8 RATZ are non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (NFTs). However, the magic lies within the metadata. Each SK8 RATZ NFT is linked to its own metadata, which simultaneously populates the token with its own distinct artwork. This metadata is permanently linked to the Ethereum blockchain via smart contracts and the IPFS cloud, with no intentions to ever modify or alter it in the future. After minting your SK8 RATZ NFT, you can view it on popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Blur, where you're also free to trade it for cryptocurrency.
        <br></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SK8 RATZ collection features 3000 NFTs minting at 0.01 ETH. Each NFT reps distinct characteristics randomly generated from a pool of over 200 hand-drawn traits, with some RATZ being rarer than others. Official Rares like Ghosts and Rainbows make up around 3% of the population, while Uncommons (aka Nakeds) make up 10%. Some of the Commons are even considered scarce, making SK8 RATZ a unique and exciting collection to own.

    <h2>Tell us more!</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SK8 RATZ was originally conceived in early October 2021 by two skaters (Ryan & Luis) who shared a love for crypto and art. Both of them had over a decade of experience creating digital art and Ryan also had 5 years of experience coding. As they sat in the lab watching the BAYC floor price rip past 2 eth for the first time, they said to themselves "Let's make an NFT project." There weren't any other skateboarding NFT projects at the time, so they researched and devised a plan.
        <br></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fortnight in, they had a plan and the official outline of the SK8 RATZ character finalized. The project was coming together nicely, but it was at this time that Luis had to walk away from it. Having his work cut out for him, Ryan spent the next 9 months carefully creating SK8 RATZ as they envisioned. It took him 5 months to design the traits and generate the RATZ and 4 months to develop the smart contract and website. The project officially launched and began minting in late August of 2022.
      </p>
      <h2>Is there a roadmap?</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fashion of creative commons and decentralization, we envision a rad community of SK8 RATZ cultivating naturally. SK8 RATZ is CC0, which means the doors are wide open for creativity. Once the community has shown it's ready for more, the Chief Rat (Ryan) will develop token-gated experiences and future drops with intent on keeping the fun alive. His experience in clothing and skateboard design also runs deep, so tangible products are definitely on the table as well.
